About Project 👇

🔍 The core focus of the project was examining net sales data and assessing the differences between planned and actual net sales across different dimensions: years, customers, countries, products, and divisions. By computing COGS, gross margin, and gross margin percentage, we gained vital insights into the company's financial well-being. 💡
